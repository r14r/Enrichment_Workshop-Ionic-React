This is a sample [Ionic ReactJS](https://ionicframework.com/docs/react) Application using the [IonPicker Component](https://ionicframework.com/docs/api/picker#properties) derived from plain javascript example provided in the [Ionic Framework Picker Documentation](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-docs/blob/master/src/demos/api/picker/index.html).

We also use [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html) to manage the state and the example is based off of the Ionic ReactJS Template so we are supporting Typescript.
