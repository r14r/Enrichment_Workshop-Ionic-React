## Getting Started

Beside the learning of using Ionic and React, the following features and topics have been covered and implemented in this app.

- Fetch API data with Hooks
- Add components and pass properties
- Navigation with parameters
- Infinite scroll and refresher
- Picker (triggered with a controller)
- Toast (triggered with a state)
- Including and using a Stencil Web Component
- Capacitor plugins share and storage
- Services worker to cache images
- Deploy with GitHub Actions

I intend to probably write one or some blog posts about the above subjects ðŸ˜‡

## Dog API

The API used in this application to browse and display doggos is the [Dog API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/), the internet's biggest collection of open source dog pictures.

Moreover than being **open source** and **free**, this API also allows **CORS** requests.

Side note: You could find more free APIs in the [public-apis](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) GitHub repo.

## Development

To develop and run this application locally, proceed as following:

```
git clone https://github.com/peterpeterparker/wooof
cd wooof
npm install
ionic serve
```
