## BMI Calculator

A basic implementation of a BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator written in [Ionic React](https://ionicframework.com/docs/react). This is more like a test project to see what it's like the integration between GitHub repositories and Zeit  integration technology, [Now](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/git-integrations/zeit-now-for-github).
So you can access this app [here](https://bmi-calculator.now.sh/).

**P.S: It looks better on a mobile device.**

#### How to run this application on your desktop:

* Install Ionic

    * [Installation guide](https://ionicframework.com/docs/intro/cli)

* Clone this repository

    * Open your terminal or cmd and run this command:
    * ```bash
        $ git clone https://github.com/krauss/BMICalculator.git
      ```
    * Next you just `cd` into the directory `BMICalculator` and run the command below:    
    *   ```bash
        $ ionic serve
        ```

P.S: Don't worry, a browser will automatically be opened when the command finishes.
